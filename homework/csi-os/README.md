Linux
=======

Pre-OS software: 

Kernel File(s): linuxKernel.png
    Description: The linux kernel can be found in the /boot folder, its
    large size as well as the version number of linux on my machine give the
    impression that this file must be the kernel.

Startup Scripts/Config Files: linuxConfigFiles1.png and linuxConfigFiles2.png
    (couldn't fit all the files on the screen at once)
    Description: The configuration files are located int /etc/init and generally
    end with '.conf'.

First Process: linuxFirstProcess.png
    Description: Under the PID column, the first process can be seen, its
    command name is 'init'. This makes sense since the configuration files are
    in the /init folder.

Network Settings: linuxNetworkSettings.png
    Description: This just shows a dialog box where the network settings can be
    altered.

Pre-OS software: macPreOS.JPG
    Description: This picture shows the drive "zorl 0". The firmware is programmed
    to ask which drive you would like to boot from. Because this computer only had
    one drive to choose from, that was the only drive shown. Once a drive has been
    chosen, the firmware loads up that kernel and continues rebooting.

Kernel file(s): macKernel.png
    Description: The kernel is named Mach, so the mach_kernel file seemed
     appropriate. Its size also seemed large enough to be a kernel.

Startup scripts/config files: macConfigFiles.png
    Description: The startup scripts and config files generally have 'rc' and
    'config' somewhere in their file name, but the whole /etc folder is
    technically the startup scripts and config files.

First Process: macFirstProcess.png
    Description: The first process can be seen at the bottom of this picture, its
    command name is 'launchd'.

Network Settings: macNetworkSettings.png
    Description: This is just a dialog box where the nextwork settings can be
    tinkered with.
