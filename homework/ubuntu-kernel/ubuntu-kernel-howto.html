            <p class ="section">Modification Steps</p>
            <p>
The first thing you need to do is add your new syscall to the syscall table.
Depending on the kernel you've obtained, the location of this file may be
different from that described here, but in general, you're looking for a file
with a name close to "syscall_32.tbl". In my case, the file is located in
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
ubuntu-quantal/arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
            </p>
            <p>
Once you locate this file, you will want to add the following line to the end of
the list of syscalls. Note that the first number is the hardcoded number that
can be used to directly call our new helloworld syscall. The second number
denotes the type of system we're working with. The third element of the line is
the name of the syscall if one wanted to call it on the commandline. The fourth
element of this line of code is the name of the function that will be called
when the system call is called.
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
350 i386    helloworld      sys_helloworld
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
            <p>
Next, in the syscalls_32.S file, you need to tell the kernel what type of output
your system call is going to generate. In this case, since we're just writing a
simple hello world, we are just going to return a long. The location of this
file in my kernel is
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
ubuntu-quantal/arch/sh/kernel/syscalls_32.S
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
And the line of code you want to add is
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
.long sys_helloworld
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
You're going to add this at the end of the file.
            </p>
            <p>
Now you need to define helloworld as a constant which will be used by the kernel
when you call your helloworld system call. The place to do this is in the header
file called unistd_32.h which is located in
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
ubuntu-quantal/arch/sh/include/asm/unistd_32.h
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
You need to add the following line to the end of the file just before the line
which defines the number of system calls in the kernel. The number should be
one more than whatever the line above it defines its system call to be.
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
#define __NR_helloworld     367
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
Also, you will need to increment the number of system calls by one (remember
they are indexed starting with 0). This should be done by altering the next line
of code.
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
#define NR_syscalls 368
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
            </p>
            <p>
Next, we need to tell the syscalls header file what signature it's looking for
when searching for your system call. This is done by adding the a line of code
to the syscalls.h file which is located in
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
ubuntu-quantal/include/linux/syscalls.h
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
The line of code to be added is
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
asmlinkage long sys_helloworld(void);
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
and should be added just before the last line of the file which is "#endif".
            </p>
            <p>
Finally, you get to write your system call! Create a file with the name
"sys_helloworld.c". This corresponds to the name we added to the syscall table.
You will want to put this file in a new directory located in the root directory
of your (used-to-be!)vanilla kernel. My folder is called "/test", but you can
call it whatever you like, but for the rest of this *howto*, I will be referring
to this folder as "test". So save your .c file in this new folder and for a
simple hello world program, all you need in the file is
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
#include <linux/kernel.h>

asmlinkage long sys_helloworld(void) {
    printk("Hello world! This freaking rocks!\n");
    return 0;
}
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
            </p>
            <p>
The next step is to link your system call to the kernel so it knows where the
function is when the system call gets called. The first element of this linking
process is creating a Makefile. When the kernel is being built, it searches for
anything called "Makefile" and uses its references to locate the object files
necessary to build. Create a file called "Makefile" in your "/test" directory
and the only thing you need to put in it is
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
obj-y := sys_helloworld.o
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
In order for the build process to even search the "/test" folder for a Makefile,
the folder needs to be added to the top-level Makefile which is automatically
read during the build. The location of this file is
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
ubuntu-quantal/Makefile
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
There is a line about 80 or so lines into the file which says
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
core-y		+= kernel/ mm/ fs/ ipc/ security/ crypto/ block/
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
You will want to add "test/" to the end of this line, resulting in
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
core-y		+= kernel/ mm/ fs/ ipc/ security/ crypto/ block/ test/
                    </code></pre>
                </div>

            </p>
            <p>
The last step before building your kernel is writing a C program which calls
your new system call. This can be located wherever you like and named whatever
you like, just like a normal C program. The contents of my C program are
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
#include <linux/types.h>
#include <linux/unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int result = syscall(350);

  if (result == -1) {
    char *errorMessage = "Oh no! My kernel fails";
  }
  return result;
}
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id = "building">
            <p class ="section">Build Steps</p>
            <p>
Now it's time to actually build your newly modified kernel! From the root
directory of your kernel, on the commandline, enter this command
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
fakeroot debian/rules clean
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
Once this is done, you're ready to call the command which builds the kernel.
                <p>
                *(Note that this takes me 2 hours so don't be alarmed if it takes
                your machine a while to complete this task. Also note that I am
                running in a virtual machine\on a laptop, so if you're on a desktop,
                things may run more quickly)*
                </p>
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
fakeroot debian/rules binary-headers binary-generic
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
Once the build it complete, there should be three new .deb files in the
directory above your kernel source. These need to be depackaged and then you
need to reboot your system to load the newly built kernel. This can be done
using the following two commands
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
sudo dpkg -i linux*3.5.0-25*.deb

sudo reboot
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
                <a href= "https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/BuildYourOwnKernel">
                    This webpage may be helpful </a>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="section">Testing</p>
            <p>
Once your system has rebooted, you are going to want to execute your C program
which used your new system call. To check to see if your syscall worked, look
in your kernel log. This can be done using the following command on the
commandline
                <div class = "codeblock">
                    <pre><code>
tail -f /var/log/kern.log
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
            </p>
            <p>
My output looked like this
            </p>
